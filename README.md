# hello-world

Hi everyone!

I'm a total noob to coding and programming. I have a passing understanding of HTML and CSS, and I'm starting to (slowly) understand how to effectively code with JavaScript. I also have a little experience with Joomla, the free content management system. As far as GitHub, well, I've recently taken a job teaching Microsoft Office to middle schoolers, only the computer lab doesn't have Microsoft Office! So I decided to teach web, and found that I was only barely staying ahead of the kids. So now I'm diving in! Hope I can contribute something.
